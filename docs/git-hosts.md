# Git hosts

GitHub and Azure DevOps, detected from the repo URL rather than configured.
`sbx publish` pushes the work branch and opens a pull request from *inside* the
sandbox, so the host never holds the credential:

```sh
sbx new --repo 'https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo' \
        --task "..." --provider azure-pat --provider claude-oauth
sbx publish <name>          # -> https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo/pullrequest/10
```

Credentials come from OpenShell providers, and the sandbox never sees them: the
provider sets an environment variable holding a *placeholder*, and the gateway
substitutes the real token into the outgoing request. An Azure DevOps PAT is
scoped to one organisation, so mint one per org and attach the right one per
session:

```sh
export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT='...'   # Code (Read & Write)
openshell provider profile import --file providers/azure-devops-pat.yaml
openshell provider create --name azure-pat --type azure-devops-pat \
        --credential AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT     # env lookup; the token stays out of your shell history
```

Pull requests on Azure DevOps are created with a plain REST call rather than the
Azure CLI, so the image stays as it is. `readonly-explore` reaches neither
`git-receive-pack` nor `_apis`, so a session under it can read a repository and
provably cannot publish to it.

The image the agent runs in, and the settings baked into it, are
[sandbox-image.md](sandbox-image.md).
